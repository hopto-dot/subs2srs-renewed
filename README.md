# subs2srs-renewed

A repository where [subs2srs2](https://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/) lives on.

Currently, the only addition in this fork is a 'smart combine lines' feature that joins a line with the next if the first line ends in から or けど (this is experimental and will be made smarter in the future). You can access this feature in the [Advanced subtitle options](https://github.com/hopto-dot/subs2srs-renewed/blob/main/Main%20Window.png?raw=true).

I added this feature quickly and without proper consideration of structure the of the application written by the previous maintainer, the new code will exist as it is until I can try to sit down with it and tidy it up.

The project has been upgraded to .NET v4.8.
